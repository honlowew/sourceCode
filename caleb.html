        <h1>Happy 18th Birthday, Snowy! üéâ</h1>
        <p>
            It's Caleb here, and I just wanted to say how proud I am of you for reaching this amazing milestone! Turning 18 is a big deal‚Äîit's the doorway to new adventures, new responsibilities, and new dreams. You've always been fearless, kind, and full of laughter, and I know these qualities will take you far.<br><br>
            But, bestie, as you step into adulthood, remember to take care of yourself‚Äîboth your body and mind. It's okay to say no, to rest when you need it, and to trust your instincts. Surround yourself with people who lift you up, not weigh you down.<br><br>
            Chase your dreams boldly, but also be patient with yourself. Growth takes time, and mistakes are just stepping stones.<br><br>
            Here's to an incredible year ahead! Stay strong, stay kind, and always keep shining! ‚≠ê
